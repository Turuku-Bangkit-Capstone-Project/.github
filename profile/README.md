# TURUKU üí§
‚ÄúAn Intelligent Sleep Tracking and Disorder Detection App‚Äù

## BACKGROUND
Sleep quality is an important clinical construct since it is increasingly common for people to complain about poor sleep quality and its impact on daytime functioning. Moreover, poor sleep quality can be an important symptom of many sleep and medical disorders. However, objective measures of sleep quality, such as polysomnography, are not readily available to most clinicians in their daily routine, and are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for epidemiological and research studies. 

A common but significant change associated with aging is a profound disruption to the daily sleep-wake cycle. It has been estimated that as many as 50% of older adults complain about difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. Poor sleep results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, in younger adults, compromised sleep has been shown to have a consistent effect on cognitive function, which may suggest that sleep problems contribute to the cognitive changes that accompany older age. The multifactorial nature of variables affecting sleep in old age cannot be overstated.

Due to these factors, several questions regarding sleep quality problems and how to improve their sleep quality should be answered by creating a smart application system to determine the cause of lack of sleep quality and how to effectively cure them. Through a cloud-based mobile application called ‚ÄúTuruku‚Äù, we will answer these questions such as ‚Äúwhat are the main problems of people‚Äôs lack of sleep?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow can we fix trouble sleeping effectively?, and  ‚Äúhow can we educate people about the lack of sleep problem?‚Äù
